# Overview
a tiny regex engine by using autamata theory.
it is a self learning project to help me try understand automata theory.

# implememtion

- implemment state object
- state object can combine to a epsilon-NFA nest
- convert epsilon-NFA nest to a epsilon-NFA dict
- convert epsilon-NFA to NFA
- use check function to check whether our str were satisfied in NFA .
